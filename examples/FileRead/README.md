# File Read

## Goal

Input a file via an HTML form and read it on the C++ WASM executable

## Notes

Sending a file to the WASM requires saving it to the Web Assembly virtual file system.

This example does not allow you to submit more than one file. You will need to refresh the page to do so.

This example does not show how to clean up the file from the virtual file system.
